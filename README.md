                                                1) Css Utility

```
    I create simple utility. so when you use them you change your project comfortable utility.
    I created Font And Typography 3 method. you will use  any one  or  two methods
 
    EM insted REM it's A best practice 
    Why? REM => it get Font size of the root element.
    EM =>  get it Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like font-size, and font size of the element.
    itself, in the case of other properties like width.
    
    
    ```
